        A large amount of paper has wasted to generate receipts at retail shops so there should be paperless billing system. Digital receipts require security
        as it is easy to alter information in digital documents and as well as authentication to prove that receipt is generated by particular individual.
        This Project explores a way to build a such paperless billing system using digital signature in order to save paper and provide security and authentication.

        The main objective involved in this project is to implement a paperless shopping System that prepare a bill and generate online receipt and also provide
        authentication and security on it. Project objectives are following:

        •	 Identifying items based on barcode and prepare bills using barcode Scanner.
        •	 Generate receipts and email them to particular individual.
        •	 Provide security to receipts using Secure Hashing Algorithm.
        •	 Provide authentication to receipts using RSA private – public key.
        •	 Provide management of product’s inventory to each registered individual.
